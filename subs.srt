1
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:31,536
Help them! Go and help them!

2
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,222
They're gonna drown!

3
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:35,278
Pull over! They're not coming up.

4
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:36,727
They'll come up.

5
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:39,226
Please, Dad? Please pull over.

6
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:42,098
You know how long
ducks can hold their breath?

7
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:43,295
No.

8
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:46,448
As long as it takes for
you to stop looking at 'em.

9
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:49,270
Then pull over and let's look.

10
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:54,367
Okay, let's look.

11
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,445
I think they're dead.

12
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:02,148
- No, they're not dead.
- But how do you know?

13
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,247
Ducks go down, ducks come up.

14
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,254
This is the natural
order of things, son.

15
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:10,823
- There they are!
- Yep.

16
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:12,424
There they are.

17
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,093
They're okay!

18
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:16,028
They're okay.

19
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,030
And there you have it, folks.

20
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:20,399
The ducks are alive and well.

21
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:23,104
Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.

22
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,484
What are you doing?

23
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:07,422
Preventing the apocalypse.

24
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:09,091
What are you doing?

25
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:22,003
Don't smile.

26
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:30,405
This is a songline.

27
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,515
Is it?

28
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,062
You can go.

29
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:55,385
You don't get to keep that.

30
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,017
Well, the...

31
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,054
The mic, okay, that's fine,

32
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:06,546
but the player, can I
have it back, please?

33
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:08,014
Please?

34
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:15,757
Thank you. I...

35
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:19,324
W-where's the tape?

36
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:22,342
What's on the tape is stolen.
You took it without permission.

37
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:24,329
No, no, not that one. That's fine.

38
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,431
The other one. It says "Niagara '81."

39
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:32,770
Please. It's me and my
kid from a long time ago.

40
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,878
It's really important to me. Please.

41
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:47,183
Thank you.

42
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:50,453
Yeah. Go, get.

43
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:51,955
Yeah, thank you.

44
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,712
Why did Travis wanna kill the President?

45
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:20,548
Travis didn't wanna kill
anyone. He's not real.

46
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,058
I don't get it.

47
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:24,367
Travis is pretend. He's in the movie.

48
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:27,938
John is real, and that's
how he got the idea.

49
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,187
So, John killed the President because he

50
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,009
- saw it in a movie?
- He didn't kill the President.

51
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,395
He tried to kill the President.

52
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:37,497
Why?

53
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:40,067
Because he's crazy, Kevin.

54
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,338
But the President's okay, right?

55
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,675
Yeah, buddy. The President's fine.

56
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,643
And there you have it, folks.

57
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,678
The President is just fine.

58
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,681
Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.

59
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,122
- Howdy.
- G'day.

60
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:05,979
Do you deliver mail to the
communities around here?

61
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,192
Yes, sir.

62
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:10,895
I'm looking for a friend...
Christopher Sunday.

63
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,864
Maybe you have an address for him.

64
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,901
If he's a friend of yours,

65
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,670
why don't you have his address?

66
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,006
I misplaced it.

67
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,643
You need to talk to Sharon.

68
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,978
Okay. Who's Sharon?

69
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,814
She's a Liaison to the
Indigenous Community.

70
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,600
All due respect, friend,
I don't need a Liaison.

71
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,055
I'm a member of the
Indigenous Community.

72
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,994
Sharon's over at the Cultural
Center on Borland Circuit.

73
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:46,374
Anything else?

74
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:47,930
Yeah.

75
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:50,599
I had my mail forwarded.

76
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:54,070
I heard how helpful you were down here.

77
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:55,538
Kevin Garvey.

78
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:07,883
May I see some ID?

79
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:10,385
Unfortunately, I lost it.

80
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:12,788
But I can tell you the return address.

81
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,256
One Matthew Jamison. Miracle, Texas.

82
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:18,325
US of A.

83
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:22,097
If that's not enough, I
can tell you what's inside.

84
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:26,934
You know the best-selling
book of all time?

85
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:31,005
I reckon it's the Bible.

86
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,339
You reckon right, my friend.

87
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:36,242
And that there...

88
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,878
is the goddamn sequel.

89
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,291
Oof.

90
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,003
Fucking asshole.

91
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,112
Full of shit. Jesus.

92
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,115
What?

93
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,132
Motherfucker!

94
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,060
Hi, Noah.

95
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,203
Is your daddy home?

96
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,705
Let Mommy, honey.

97
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:20,117
Hello?

98
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:23,045
Hello. This is.

99
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,246
Frank Johnson from
the Episcopal council.

100
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:28,415
Can I speak to Reverend Matt Jamison?

101
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,650
- Frank Johnson?
- Yes.

102
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:32,722
Are you sure this isn't the Former.

103
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:34,602
Police Chief of Mapleton, New York?

104
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:37,114
Because I know Matt
would wanna talk to him.

105
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:41,393
- Who is it?
- It's your buddy in Australia.

106
00:10:42,663 --> 00:10:44,596
I'm taking Noah to the park.

107
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:45,998
You want me to come?

108
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,201
Not when you have
important work to do, Matt.

109
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:57,008
- Hello?
- Mary seems pissed.

110
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,844
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

111
00:10:58,846 --> 00:11:00,732
We're just working through some...

112
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:03,764
We're fine. How are things down under?

113
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:05,550
Well, Matt,

114
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:08,452
funny you should ask about
how things are going down here

115
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:10,821
because it seems like
you don't give a shit.

116
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:13,557
- What?
- I'm not in it, asshole.

117
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:17,509
- I'm sorry?
- I'm not in it.

118
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:21,232
I spent hours talking you
through what I'm doing down here.

119
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:23,858
There's not a word in your goddamn book.

120
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:27,570
Well, the book is about
what's happening to your son.

121
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,472
You know, if he were in Australia...

122
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:31,440
I don't want him in Australia.

123
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:35,511
I don't want him anywhere
fucking near Australia!

124
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:37,613
Okay.

125
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:41,383
Since you clearly weren't
listening the first time I told you,

126
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:44,753
I am not a part of Kevin Jr.'s story.

127
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:46,922
He's a part of mine.

128
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:49,892
He's the one who guided me here.

129
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,593
Why isn't that in your book?

130
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:53,528
Well, I'm sorry.

131
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,230
W-when did this happen?

132
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,098
When he was eight years old.

133
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,717
Yeah, well, children don't
feature prominently in scripture.

134
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,171
W-what about Abraham's kid?

135
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,707
- Isaac? He was 36.
- No, no.

136
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,043
When Abraham tried to sacrifice him.

137
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,946
He was a grown man. 36 years old.

138
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,016
That makes no fucking sense at all.

139
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,993
Did you...

140
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,068
Did you get the money I sent you?

141
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,737
Yeah, I did. Ha. What's it for?

142
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:24,791
Well, just to help you out.

143
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:26,426
Really?

144
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:28,895
It's not so I'll keep my mouth shut

145
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:31,256
and not tell my son you're writing

146
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,866
an unauthorized fucking
biography about him?

147
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:38,503
Kevin, telling him would
not be a good idea.

148
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:40,672
He needs to just go through his life.

149
00:12:40,674 --> 00:12:43,976
Knowing any of this would
not be in his best interests.

150
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:46,378
It would be in your best interest

151
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,679
to pick up some scuba gear,

152
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:50,815
because if I fail down here,

153
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:54,785
you are gonna be under a fuck
of a lot of water, shithead!

154
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:59,357
Okay. Best of luck with that, Kevin.

155
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,359
Go fuck yourself, Matt.

156
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:51,206
Hello.

157
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,881
Excuse me. Is Sharon around?

158
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,450
She's in the crapper.

159
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:05,352
You can wait in her office.

160
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,142
Great. Thanks.

161
00:14:08,324 --> 00:14:09,556
Do I know you, mate?

162
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,526
I sure hope not.

163
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:27,640
Good afternoon.

164
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:30,009
You must be Sharon. I'm Frank.

165
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:33,378
- Hello.
- Is that snake Papunya?

166
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,913
It is indeed.

167
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,313
- How'd you guess?
- I'd know Papunya anywhere.

168
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:40,652
They have a very precise style.

169
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:43,055
Actually, I painted it myself.

170
00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:45,490
- You did not.
- I did.

171
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:48,325
Well, then you are incredibly talented.

172
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:52,263
So, what brings you here, Frank?

173
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:55,966
I'm looking for a cleverman
named Christopher Sunday.

174
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:57,968
I was told you might
have an address for him.

175
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,937
Well, the name rings a bell,

176
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:01,872
but if you're making a
documentary, you'll have to go...

177
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:04,107
No, no, no. Documentaries are boring.

178
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:07,843
I'm just seeking enlightenment.

179
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:11,081
I'm only interested in
his wisdom, his counsel,

180
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,932
- nothing else.
- I'd have to accompany you.

181
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:16,152
I wouldn't want it any other way.

182
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:20,790
Let me see if I can get
that address for you.

183
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,658
Is this your son?

184
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,661
My grandson, Ollie.

185
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,679
He wants to be an astronaut.

186
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:33,268
My son wanted to be an
anchorman on the news.

187
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,838
- Yeah? And did he?
- Nah. He's a cop.

188
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,272
A good one.

189
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:40,841
And your... Your wife?

190
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:43,344
She passed.

191
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:45,012
Cancer.

192
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,947
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

193
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,749
It was a long time ago.

194
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,753
- Did you find him?
- It seems that,

195
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:52,288
um, Chris lives in a...

196
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:54,708
_ - community just a few...

197
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:59,326
I'd like you to hear my side.

198
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,797
"Appropriation of sacred
ceremonies without permission,"

199
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,666
"theft of creation songs,"

200
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:10,119
"misrepresentation of identity.
Under no circumstances"

201
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,838
"should this man be given
access to tribal elders."

202
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,124
Shame on you. You've
stolen from these people.

203
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,909
Really? I've stolen?

204
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:21,713
Same way your government stole a
whole generation of their children?

205
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,516
We apologized for that!

206
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:25,551
Shame on you, Sharon.

207
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:27,786
I have lived among these people.

208
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,888
I am trying to fucking
save these people.

209
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,233
Save them from what?! Oi!

210
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:50,050
Christopher Sunday.

211
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,734
I'm sorry if I mispronounced.

212
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:56,236
Are you Christopher Sunday?

213
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:57,604
Chris.

214
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:01,307
Chris, it's a real honor to meet you.

215
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,244
I am Kevin, Totem of the Bush Snake.

216
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:09,249
I've come a long way to find you.

217
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:13,786
You're scared.

218
00:18:17,258 --> 00:18:19,266
I am, yes.

219
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:23,500
Of what?

220
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,870
I used to hear voices.

221
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:36,173
They started about five
minutes after it happened,

222
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,975
after people disappeared.

223
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:41,412
So they put me in an institution.

224
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:43,503
And there I stayed

225
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,000
arguing with something
nobody else could even see,

226
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,785
fighting it.

227
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:50,853
And then I stopped fighting.

228
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,425
And I started doing what
the voices told me.

229
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:59,438
The last thing they
told me was to leave,

230
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,426
to go to Australia.

231
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:07,303
It's a pretty big country you got here.

232
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:10,817
A little specificity
would've been nice, but.

233
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:14,075
I figured instructions were forthcoming,

234
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:16,745
and I always wanted to
check out the Opera House,

235
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:19,181
so I flew to Sydney.

236
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:22,483
Bought a ticket for Verdi,
put on a nice suit,

237
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:25,320
and I'm on my way from the hotel

238
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:29,156
when this guy, this hippie
with a red headband...

239
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,361
walks right up to me and says,

240
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:36,297
"Do you wanna talk to God?"

241
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,113
That's gotta be it, right?

242
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:42,636
So I said, "Fuck, yeah,
I wanna talk to God."

243
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,220
And he said,

244
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,522
"Then you've gotta talk
in God's tongue, mate."

245
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:50,444
God's tongue, it turns out,

246
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:53,979
is an experimental,
high-end hallucinogen

247
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:55,930
this guys brews in his basement.

248
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:57,901
And I wake up

249
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,134
two weeks later

250
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:02,855
in a hotel room in Perth

251
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:05,057
on the opposite fucking coast.

252
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:08,060
There's a smoldering mattress next to me

253
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:11,459
and a bunch of white dudes
lying around in war paint.

254
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:16,434
And I have no fucking
memory how I got there

255
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:18,837
or what happened while I did.

256
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,553
Also,

257
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,735
God did not talk to me.

258
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,945
And I'm thinking this is
a fucking waste of time,

259
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:32,850
at best, a misguided detour...

260
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,390
when I notice the TV in
the hotel room is on.

261
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:45,027
And do you know what
I saw on that TV, Chris?

262
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:48,564
A chicken.

263
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,834
On October the 14th,

264
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:55,705
a town in the outback lost
its entire population.

265
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:58,040
A small town, only 14 people.

266
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:01,543
But all of them vanished,
even the animals.

267
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:05,013
Every living thing in that town was gone

268
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,715
except for one thing...

269
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:08,550
An egg.

270
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:11,653
Two days later, it hatched

271
00:21:11,655 --> 00:21:13,852
and they named him Tony.

272
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,192
At first, nobody took him seriously.

273
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,461
But then rumors started.

274
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:24,197
Rumors that the chicken
could help people find

275
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,068
whatever they were looking for.

276
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:29,169
And this is the first
fucking thing I hear

277
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:32,673
when I wake up from a
two-week acid trip?

278
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:35,719
It's got to be a fucking sign. So,

279
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,977
I hop on the train

280
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:41,915
4,000 kilometers back
across the country,

281
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,116
and I go see Tony.

282
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:46,218
So, I give this guy my money,

283
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,287
guy puts the chicken in front of me,

284
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:49,625
and says,

285
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:51,790
"What are you looking for?"

286
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:55,302
"Well, I don't know
what I'm looking for yet.

287
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:58,096
That's the point. I
need Tony to tell me."

288
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:00,666
And the guy says,
"Doesn't work that way."

289
00:22:00,668 --> 00:22:04,603
"You've gotta give Tony
something to look for."

290
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:06,972
So I said, "Purpose!"

291
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,275
"I want some fucking purpose."

292
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:17,505
And that very minute,

293
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:21,452
Tony jumped up on my
pack and starts pecking.

294
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:26,323
He was pecking...

295
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:28,892
this.

296
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:39,668
When my kid was about eight years old,

297
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:43,239
my wife gave him a tape
recorder for Christmas.

298
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:45,474
She died about a month later,

299
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:47,153
so he...

300
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,112
He kept it with him
all the time. All the time.

301
00:22:51,682 --> 00:22:54,282
Well, that summer, I
took him on a road trip

302
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:56,251
to Niagara Falls.

303
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:02,356
And he just about drove me nuts...

304
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:11,465
recording everything we said.

305
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,234
Excuse me.

306
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:22,042
I like listening to it.

307
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,313
This is the tape that Tony pecked.

308
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:30,316
I didn't rewind it.

309
00:23:33,022 --> 00:23:34,788
I put it in the player

310
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:39,592
and waited for one last
voice to tell me what to do.

311
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:43,629
You have to sing it.

312
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,402
Come on.

313
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:48,333
It's for little kids.
You're a big kid now.

314
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:50,810
You have to or it won't stop.

315
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,794
It's gonna get in the car!

316
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:55,640
We're pulled over. We're safe.

317
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,608
Please, Daddy? Just sing it.

318
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:01,512
Okay.

319
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:27,238
You did it!

320
00:24:36,214 --> 00:24:40,717
On the seventh-year anniversary
of the Sudden Departure,

321
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:44,484
I believe the rains will come,

322
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:46,855
and with them

323
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,557
a great flood.

324
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:54,195
I have to sing to make it stop.

325
00:24:58,301 --> 00:24:59,783
You have to sing?

326
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,402
For the last two years,

327
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:05,673
I've been working my
way down the songline.

328
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:10,410
I don't have to tell you every
community has a different part,

329
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:14,715
so I've had to learn
it piece by piece...

330
00:25:14,717 --> 00:25:16,816
Every sacred site,

331
00:25:16,818 --> 00:25:18,885
every ceremony,

332
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,453
every word.

333
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:22,822
You want my song?

334
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:25,258
It's the last one.

335
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:30,130
The last one.

336
00:25:30,132 --> 00:25:33,099
And it is my understanding

337
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:35,968
that you are the only man alive

338
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,636
who knows it.

339
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:42,174
My song is bring the rain, not stopping.

340
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:45,483
Well,

341
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:50,189
that's all subject to interpretation.

342
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,617
You want to stop the flood?

343
00:25:55,058 --> 00:25:56,487
I do.

344
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,959
Start there.

345
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,568
You got a deal.

346
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,144
Can you see the problem?

347
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,081
Yeah, your swamp cooler's
leaking like a motherfucker.

348
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,770
- Can you fix it, then?
- You got a pipe wrench

349
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,825
or some duct tape...

350
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:34,906
Shit!

351
00:26:37,642 --> 00:26:39,328
Shit!

352
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,297
Don't believe a word
that woman says about me.

353
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,037
Remember, we've got a deal!

354
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:59,747
I rolled the other way.
You saw me, right?

355
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:02,449
I... I tried to miss you.

356
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:05,056
- Chris, can you hear me?
- Settle down.

357
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:07,063
I'm just concerned that when we get to

358
00:27:07,183 --> 00:27:09,253
the hospital, they're gonna separate us.

359
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:12,425
And Chris promised he'd teach me
something. Didn't you, Chris?

360
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:15,031
Chris, Chris, Chris, nod
if you can hear me.

361
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,280
Otherwise, they're not gonna believe me.

362
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,198
Sit! Sit.

363
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,568
Friend, I am acting in
your best interest.

364
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,704
You are looking at an
initiated Yanmedjaran.

365
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:28,775
Show a little respect
for your fucking elder.

366
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:45,791
I'm sorry I lost it.

367
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:49,860
You're gonna leave me here?!

368
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:03,507
Fuck me!

369
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:07,629
Fucking, fucking, fuck, fuck, fuck!

370
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:15,118
I don't think this is the
way we're supposed to go.

371
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,167
Garvey men

372
00:28:17,287 --> 00:28:20,723
don't follow a highlighter
on a goddamn triptych, son.

373
00:28:20,725 --> 00:28:22,658
But what if we get lost?

374
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,993
AAA wants you to take the interstates

375
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,030
to get you to drive by
the AAA Howard Johnsons

376
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,966
and the AAA giant balls of twine.

377
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:32,767
You want a real adventure,

378
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:34,769
you gotta chart your own course.

379
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:42,699
Hey!

380
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:50,040
Stop!!

381
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:52,542
Hey! Stop!

382
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:54,945
Stop!!

383
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:56,980
Man, what are you doing?

384
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,503
They didn't take me.

385
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:04,797
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down.

386
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,123
Let's just talk for a sec.

387
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,700
They didn't take me.

388
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:12,828
Buddy, they didn't take most of us.

389
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,596
You're not alone, trust me.

390
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:16,865
But that was seven years ago.

391
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:19,723
Would you kill a baby

392
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:21,670
if it would cure cancer?

393
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,441
What?

394
00:30:25,046 --> 00:30:27,075
Would you kill a baby

395
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,944
if it would cure cancer?

396
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:32,914
No.

397
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,386
That is exactly what I said.

398
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:41,979
Wait!

399
00:30:53,802 --> 00:30:55,635
Whoa, shit!

400
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,300
Please let there be water.

401
00:31:28,302 --> 00:31:30,835
Please let there be some goddamn water.

402
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:34,771
Fucking alcoholic.

403
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,440
Jesus.

404
00:31:38,011 --> 00:31:40,044
I know what you're trying to do,

405
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:42,213
but it's not gonna work!

406
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:46,117
You can't stop me, asshole!

407
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:10,494
No!

408
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,909
No! No!

409
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:16,811
No!

410
00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:18,547
No!

411
00:32:55,384 --> 00:32:57,015
Please.

412
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:07,093
Kevin Garvey Jr. Reporting.

413
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:21,947
No. God.

414
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:27,645
God.

415
00:34:19,463 --> 00:34:22,847
Buddy, I know you're my totem, but.

416
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:27,434
I got some bad news for you.

417
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:30,504
If I go down, I don't
think I'm getting up.

418
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:33,040
So...

419
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:37,244
I need to eat you.

420
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:42,582
I'm sorry.

421
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:46,166
Know that

422
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,791
you gave your life...

423
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:54,760
For something greater than yourself.

424
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:24,088
Come on!

425
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:30,200
Shit!

426
00:38:21,155 --> 00:38:28,561
Help.

427
00:38:44,144 --> 00:38:46,578
Hey there.

428
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:18,775
No.

429
00:39:23,582 --> 00:39:25,048
Fucker!

430
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:29,117
Hello?

431
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:33,789
Anybody here?

432
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,043
Hello?

433
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:58,780
Will you accept a collect
international call from...

434
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:01,215
Kevin Garvey Sr.

435
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:04,618
All right, fine.

436
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,388
Do you know what time it is here?

437
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,791
I don't care what time
it is. What day is it?

438
00:40:10,793 --> 00:40:12,626
- What?
- What day is it?

439
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:15,043
How long since we last talked?

440
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,198
That was three weeks ago.

441
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:20,967
Shit.

442
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:23,440
That's just, like, eight days left.

443
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,170
Shit!

444
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,573
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Kevin.

445
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:29,876
I'm actually glad you called.

446
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:32,979
Could you send a photocopy
of the book back to me?

447
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:35,780
- I... I gave the original...
- I threw it away.

448
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:37,516
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

449
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,019
Look, I... I need you to
call the Kurripa Hospital.

450
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,454
That's Kur-rip-pa.

451
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:47,458
Find out if there's a patient
there named Christopher Sunday.

452
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:49,714
Matt?

453
00:40:51,264 --> 00:40:53,030
You threw it away?

454
00:40:53,032 --> 00:40:56,181
My friend, you've gotta move
past that dumb book of yours.

455
00:40:56,301 --> 00:40:59,837
I don't know where I am,
but once I find out,

456
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,673
I'm gonna need your help in
getting to this hospital.

457
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,441
- Kevin.
- Yeah?

458
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:06,744
Go fuck yourself.

459
00:41:38,842 --> 00:41:41,176
- Hey there!
- Hello.

460
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:45,580
You're building a boat.

461
00:41:51,353 --> 00:41:52,620
For the flood.

462
00:41:58,761 --> 00:42:01,327
I need to get to the
hospital in Kurripa.

463
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:04,163
Any chance you guys could
give me a ride there?

464
00:42:04,165 --> 00:42:07,200
Lady of the house will take better
care of you than the hospital.

465
00:42:07,202 --> 00:42:10,990
No, I'm fine. Anybody here
know Christopher Sunday?

466
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:13,907
Yeah, sure. We all know each other.

467
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,174
It's a tiny country.

468
00:42:15,176 --> 00:42:16,782
I know Chris.

469
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:20,412
You're the fella that landed on him.

470
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,416
He's dead.

471
00:42:29,556 --> 00:42:31,423
He's dead?

472
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:34,759
Shit.

473
00:43:01,586 --> 00:43:04,187
"Caleb's arthritis."

474
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:07,257
You Caleb?

475
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:09,058
I'm in pain, buddy.

476
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,097
Let him up.

477
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,537
Okay, let him up!

478
00:46:02,156 --> 00:46:03,622
Hey.

479
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,428
What are you ladies up to?

480
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,932
Come on.

481
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,408
Hello.

482
00:46:59,477 --> 00:47:00,759
Hi.

483
00:47:02,947 --> 00:47:05,014
Would you like some tea?

484
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:11,452
How's your arm?

485
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:14,922
Itches like hell.

486
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:20,528
We get a lot of brown and
tiger snakes out here.

487
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,064
I gave you antivenom for
both just to be safe.

488
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,933
Much obliged.

489
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:34,508
You looked through my photos.

490
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:38,145
I was hungry. It was in the fridge.

491
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,117
What's your name?

492
00:47:45,921 --> 00:47:47,287
Grace.

493
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,647
Nice to meet you.

494
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:53,893
- I'm Kev...
- I just killed a man.

495
00:47:58,698 --> 00:48:00,104
Okay.

496
00:48:00,805 --> 00:48:03,201
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

497
00:48:04,905 --> 00:48:07,739
The other ladies you saw,
they had nothing to do with it.

498
00:48:07,741 --> 00:48:09,660
I'm hoping you'll consider leaving them

499
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,789
out of whatever you tell the police.

500
00:48:14,214 --> 00:48:16,880
Are you all alone out here?

501
00:48:18,751 --> 00:48:20,112
Yes.

502
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:23,454
Your family's gone?

503
00:48:24,116 --> 00:48:25,556
Yes.

504
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,026
On the 14th?

505
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:31,028
It was the 15th here.

506
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,197
Fuck. I keep forgetting that.

507
00:48:36,068 --> 00:48:37,600
You were with them?

508
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:40,190
I was in town

509
00:48:41,387 --> 00:48:42,609
at the Big W.

510
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:47,230
The register girl vanished
right in front of me.

511
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,846
She was holding my box of Weet-Bix.

512
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:53,949
Took it with her.

513
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,021
I knew what it was the
moment it happened.

514
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:03,192
The Rapture.

515
00:49:05,129 --> 00:49:08,929
I finally made it home the next night.

516
00:49:08,931 --> 00:49:11,422
I already knew the chapel would be

517
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:14,107
empty before I stepped foot inside.

518
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:18,706
Their Bibles...

519
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:22,243
Liam's, Abigail's,

520
00:49:22,245 --> 00:49:25,212
David's, Samantha's,

521
00:49:25,214 --> 00:49:28,415
Jimmy's, Sam,

522
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:30,583
my husband, his Bible, too.

523
00:49:33,522 --> 00:49:35,822
All in a nice, neat row.

524
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:41,994
And when I saw them in that moment...

525
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:45,664
I felt so blessed...

526
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:48,663
because God showed me.

527
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:55,074
He gave me confirmation that
my family now sat by his side.

528
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,711
For two years, I spread his word.

529
00:50:00,713 --> 00:50:04,349
For two years, I endured...

530
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,253
and held true.

531
00:50:15,627 --> 00:50:18,562
Then I received a phone call.

532
00:50:18,564 --> 00:50:21,598
Remains had been found on my property.

533
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,771
The remains of five children.

534
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:32,896
Just bones.

535
00:50:33,911 --> 00:50:36,145
Bleached in the sun.

536
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:41,243
The phones were down.

537
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:47,273
They had no way of knowing
if I was ever coming home

538
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:51,359
or if I had simply vanished
like their father had.

539
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:54,662
So, they set out on foot...

540
00:50:55,899 --> 00:50:57,832
Across the flats...

541
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:00,802
Alone.

542
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:09,376
I thought they had gone, you see?

543
00:51:11,414 --> 00:51:13,680
Gone with everyone else.

544
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,855
I never even considered
searching for them.

545
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,660
If I had...

546
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:40,305
I took the cross from the chapel

547
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:42,274
and brought it out there...

548
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,745
To mark the place where they died.

549
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:54,919
The place where I found you.

550
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:05,630
This was in your hand.

551
00:52:11,404 --> 00:52:15,238
A page written like scripture.

552
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,709
One I'd never seen or heard of before.

553
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:21,719
"It tells of a man,"

554
00:52:22,648 --> 00:52:25,148
"a police chief named Kevin..."

555
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:31,587
"who drowned and passed
into the land of the dead"

556
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:33,222
"and spoke to them."

557
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:37,293
"Who freed them from their pain"

558
00:52:37,295 --> 00:52:38,827
"and rose again."

559
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:43,732
Just 20 kilometers from here...

560
00:52:45,135 --> 00:52:49,270
there's a police Chief named Kevin.

561
00:52:51,274 --> 00:52:53,508
What are the chances of that?

562
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:56,143
It had to be him.

563
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,481
So, I went to him, to Kevin,

564
00:53:00,483 --> 00:53:03,184
and I asked for his help.

565
00:53:05,321 --> 00:53:07,395
And when he refused,

566
00:53:07,856 --> 00:53:09,989
I drowned him...

567
00:53:12,728 --> 00:53:16,162
Because I thought he was testing me.

568
00:53:17,466 --> 00:53:20,601
Because I thought he'd come back.

569
00:53:22,002 --> 00:53:24,637
And once I'd proven my faith,

570
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:26,856
he would have no choice

571
00:53:26,976 --> 00:53:29,251
but to help me talk to my children

572
00:53:30,044 --> 00:53:32,044
one last time.

573
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:40,652
So, I thought you were sent by God.

574
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:47,726
Sent with a message just for me.

575
00:53:58,337 --> 00:54:00,804
But you're not an angel.

576
00:54:02,174 --> 00:54:04,141
There is no message.

577
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:08,078
And God doesn't care about me.

578
00:54:15,654 --> 00:54:18,854
It's all just a story I told myself.

579
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:27,497
It's just a stupid, silly story.

580
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:33,602
And I believed it because...

581
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:45,347
I've gotta be crazy, haven't I?

582
00:54:52,087 --> 00:54:53,887
No, Grace.

583
00:54:56,025 --> 00:54:59,893
I don't think you're crazy at all.

584
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:06,866
You just got the wrong Kevin.

585
00:55:23,795 --> 00:55:27,018
