1
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:21,536
Help them! Go and help them!

2
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,222
They're gonna drown!

3
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:25,278
Pull over! They're not coming up.

4
00:00:25,398 --> 00:00:26,727
They'll come up.

5
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:29,226
Please, Dad? Please pull over.

6
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:32,098
You know how long
ducks can hold their breath?

7
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:33,295
No.

8
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:36,448
As long as it takes for
you to stop looking at 'em.

9
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,270
Then pull over and let's look.

10
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:44,367
Okay, let's look.

11
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,445
I think they're dead.

12
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:52,148
- No, they're not dead.
- But how do you know?

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,247
Ducks go down, ducks come up.

14
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:58,254
This is the natural
order of things, son.

15
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:00,823
- There they are!
- Yep.

16
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:02,424
There they are.

17
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:04,093
They're okay!

18
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:06,028
They're okay.

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,030
And there you have it, folks.

20
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:10,399
The ducks are alive and well.

21
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:13,104
Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.

22
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,484
What are you doing?

23
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:57,422
Preventing the apocalypse.

24
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:59,091
What are you doing?

25
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:12,003
Don't smile.

26
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:20,405
This is a songline.

27
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,515
Is it?

28
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:40,062
You can go.

29
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:45,385
You don't get to keep that.

30
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,017
Well, the...

31
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:53,054
The mic, okay, that's fine,

32
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:56,546
but the player, can I
have it back, please?

33
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,014
Please?

34
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,757
Thank you. I...

35
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,324
W-where's the tape?

36
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:12,342
What's on the tape is stolen.
You took it without permission.

37
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,329
No, no, not that one. That's fine.

38
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:17,431
The other one. It says "Niagara '81."

39
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,770
Please. It's me and my
kid from a long time ago.

40
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,878
It's really important to me. Please.

41
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:37,183
Thank you.

42
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:40,453
Yeah. Go, get.

43
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:41,955
Yeah, thank you.

44
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:07,712
Why did Travis wanna kill the President?

45
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:10,548
Travis didn't wanna kill
anyone. He's not real.

46
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,058
I don't get it.

47
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:14,367
Travis is pretend. He's in the movie.

48
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:17,938
John is real, and that's
how he got the idea.

49
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:20,187
So, John killed the President because he

50
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:23,009
- saw it in a movie?
- He didn't kill the President.

51
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,395
He tried to kill the President.

52
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,497
Why?

53
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:30,067
Because he's crazy, Kevin.

54
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:35,338
But the President's okay, right?

55
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,675
Yeah, buddy. The President's fine.

56
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:40,643
And there you have it, folks.

57
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:42,678
The President is just fine.

58
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,681
Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.

59
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,122
- Howdy.
- G'day.

60
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:55,979
Do you deliver mail to the
communities around here?

61
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,192
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:57,194 --> 00:07:00,895
I'm looking for a friend...
Christopher Sunday.

63
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:02,864
Maybe you have an address for him.

64
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,901
If he's a friend of yours,

65
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:08,670
why don't you have his address?

66
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:11,006
I misplaced it.

67
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:15,643
You need to talk to Sharon.

68
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,978
Okay. Who's Sharon?

69
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,814
She's a Liaison to the
Indigenous Community.

70
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,600
All due respect, friend,
I don't need a Liaison.

71
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,055
I'm a member of the
Indigenous Community.

72
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,994
Sharon's over at the Cultural
Center on Borland Circuit.

73
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,374
Anything else?

74
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:37,930
Yeah.

75
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:40,599
I had my mail forwarded.

76
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:44,070
I heard how helpful you were down here.

77
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:45,538
Kevin Garvey.

78
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:57,883
May I see some ID?

79
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:00,385
Unfortunately, I lost it.

80
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:02,788
But I can tell you the return address.

81
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,256
One Matthew Jamison. Miracle, Texas.

82
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:08,325
US of A.

83
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:12,097
If that's not enough, I
can tell you what's inside.

84
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,934
You know the best-selling
book of all time?

85
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,005
I reckon it's the Bible.

86
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:23,339
You reckon right, my friend.

87
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:26,242
And that there...

88
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:28,878
is the goddamn sequel.

89
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,291
Oof.

90
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:31,003
Fucking asshole.

91
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,112
Full of shit. Jesus.

92
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,115
What?

93
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:49,132
Motherfucker!

94
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,060
Hi, Noah.

95
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,203
Is your daddy home?

96
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:08,705
Let Mommy, honey.

97
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,117
Hello?

98
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:13,045
Hello. This is.

99
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:16,246
Frank Johnson from
the Episcopal council.

100
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,415
Can I speak to Reverend Matt Jamison?

101
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,650
- Frank Johnson?
- Yes.

102
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:22,722
Are you sure this isn't the Former.

103
00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:24,602
Police Chief of Mapleton, New York?

104
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:27,114
Because I know Matt
would wanna talk to him.

105
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:31,393
- Who is it?
- It's your buddy in Australia.

106
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:34,596
I'm taking Noah to the park.

107
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:35,998
You want me to come?

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,201
Not when you have
important work to do, Matt.

109
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:47,008
- Hello?
- Mary seems pissed.

110
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,844
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

111
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,732
We're just working through some...

112
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,764
We're fine. How are things down under?

113
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,550
Well, Matt,

114
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:58,452
funny you should ask about
how things are going down here

115
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,821
because it seems like
you don't give a shit.

116
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:03,557
- What?
- I'm not in it, asshole.

117
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:07,509
- I'm sorry?
- I'm not in it.

118
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:11,232
I spent hours talking you
through what I'm doing down here.

119
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:13,858
There's not a word in your goddamn book.

120
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:17,570
Well, the book is about
what's happening to your son.

121
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,472
You know, if he were in Australia...

122
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:21,440
I don't want him in Australia.

123
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:25,511
I don't want him anywhere
fucking near Australia!

124
00:11:26,288 --> 00:11:27,613
Okay.

125
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,383
Since you clearly weren't
listening the first time I told you,

126
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:34,753
I am not a part of Kevin Jr.'s story.

127
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,922
He's a part of mine.

128
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:39,892
He's the one who guided me here.

129
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:41,593
Why isn't that in your book?

130
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:43,528
Well, I'm sorry.

131
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,230
W-when did this happen?

132
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:47,098
When he was eight years old.

133
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:51,717
Yeah, well, children don't
feature prominently in scripture.

134
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,171
W-what about Abraham's kid?

135
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:56,707
- Isaac? He was 36.
- No, no.

136
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:59,043
When Abraham tried to sacrifice him.

137
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:01,946
He was a grown man. 36 years old.

138
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:06,016
That makes no fucking sense at all.

139
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,993
Did you...

140
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:10,068
Did you get the money I sent you?

141
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,737
Yeah, I did. Ha. What's it for?

142
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,791
Well, just to help you out.

143
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:16,426
Really?

144
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,895
It's not so I'll keep my mouth shut

145
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:21,256
and not tell my son you're writing

146
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:24,866
an unauthorized fucking
biography about him?

147
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:28,503
Kevin, telling him would
not be a good idea.

148
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:30,672
He needs to just go through his life.

149
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:33,976
Knowing any of this would
not be in his best interests.

150
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:36,378
It would be in your best interest

151
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,679
to pick up some scuba gear,

152
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,815
because if I fail down here,

153
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:44,785
you are gonna be under a fuck
of a lot of water, shithead!

154
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:49,357
Okay. Best of luck with that, Kevin.

155
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:51,359
Go fuck yourself, Matt.

156
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,206
Hello.

157
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:50,881
Excuse me. Is Sharon around?

158
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,450
She's in the crapper.

159
00:13:53,452 --> 00:13:55,352
You can wait in her office.

160
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:57,142
Great. Thanks.

161
00:13:58,324 --> 00:13:59,556
Do I know you, mate?

162
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,526
I sure hope not.

163
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:17,640
Good afternoon.

164
00:14:17,642 --> 00:14:20,009
You must be Sharon. I'm Frank.

165
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:23,378
- Hello.
- Is that snake Papunya?

166
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,913
It is indeed.

167
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:28,313
- How'd you guess?
- I'd know Papunya anywhere.

168
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,652
They have a very precise style.

169
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:33,055
Actually, I painted it myself.

170
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:35,490
- You did not.
- I did.

171
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:38,325
Well, then you are incredibly talented.

172
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:42,263
So, what brings you here, Frank?

173
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:45,966
I'm looking for a cleverman
named Christopher Sunday.

174
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,968
I was told you might
have an address for him.

175
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,937
Well, the name rings a bell,

176
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,872
but if you're making a
documentary, you'll have to go...

177
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:54,107
No, no, no. Documentaries are boring.

178
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:57,843
I'm just seeking enlightenment.

179
00:14:57,845 --> 00:15:01,081
I'm only interested in
his wisdom, his counsel,

180
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,932
- nothing else.
- I'd have to accompany you.

181
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:06,152
I wouldn't want it any other way.

182
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:10,790
Let me see if I can get
that address for you.

183
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:13,658
Is this your son?

184
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,661
My grandson, Ollie.

185
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:18,679
He wants to be an astronaut.

186
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:23,268
My son wanted to be an
anchorman on the news.

187
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,838
- Yeah? And did he?
- Nah. He's a cop.

188
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,272
A good one.

189
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:30,841
And your... Your wife?

190
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,344
She passed.

191
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,012
Cancer.

192
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:36,947
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

193
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:38,749
It was a long time ago.

194
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,753
- Did you find him?
- It seems that,

195
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,288
um, Chris lives in a...

196
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,708
_ - community just a few...

197
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:49,326
I'd like you to hear my side.

198
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,797
"Appropriation of sacred
ceremonies without permission,"

199
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,666
"theft of creation songs,"

200
00:15:56,668 --> 00:16:00,119
"misrepresentation of identity.
Under no circumstances"

201
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,838
"should this man be given
access to tribal elders."

202
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,124
Shame on you. You've
stolen from these people.

203
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:07,909
Really? I've stolen?

204
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:11,713
Same way your government stole a
whole generation of their children?

205
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:13,516
We apologized for that!

206
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:15,551
Shame on you, Sharon.

207
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:17,786
I have lived among these people.

208
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:20,888
I am trying to fucking
save these people.

209
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,233
Save them from what?! Oi!

210
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:40,050
Christopher Sunday.

211
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,734
I'm sorry if I mispronounced.

212
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:46,236
Are you Christopher Sunday?

213
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:47,604
Chris.

214
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:51,307
Chris, it's a real honor to meet you.

215
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:54,244
I am Kevin, Totem of the Bush Snake.

216
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:59,249
I've come a long way to find you.

217
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:03,786
You're scared.

218
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:09,266
I am, yes.

219
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,500
Of what?

220
00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:20,870
I used to hear voices.

221
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:26,173
They started about five
minutes after it happened,

222
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,975
after people disappeared.

223
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:31,412
So they put me in an institution.

224
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,503
And there I stayed

225
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:37,000
arguing with something
nobody else could even see,

226
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,785
fighting it.

227
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,853
And then I stopped fighting.

228
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,425
And I started doing what
the voices told me.

229
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:49,438
The last thing they
told me was to leave,

230
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,426
to go to Australia.

231
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,303
It's a pretty big country you got here.

232
00:18:57,305 --> 00:19:00,817
A little specificity
would've been nice, but.

233
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:04,075
I figured instructions were forthcoming,

234
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,745
and I always wanted to
check out the Opera House,

235
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:09,181
so I flew to Sydney.

236
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,483
Bought a ticket for Verdi,
put on a nice suit,

237
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,320
and I'm on my way from the hotel

238
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:19,156
when this guy, this hippie
with a red headband...

239
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,361
walks right up to me and says,

240
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:26,297
"Do you wanna talk to God?"

241
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,113
That's gotta be it, right?

242
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:32,636
So I said, "Fuck, yeah,
I wanna talk to God."

243
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,220
And he said,

244
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,522
"Then you've gotta talk
in God's tongue, mate."

245
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:40,444
God's tongue, it turns out,

246
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,979
is an experimental,
high-end hallucinogen

247
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:45,930
this guys brews in his basement.

248
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:47,901
And I wake up

249
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,134
two weeks later

250
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:52,855
in a hotel room in Perth

251
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,057
on the opposite fucking coast.

252
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,060
There's a smoldering mattress next to me

253
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:01,459
and a bunch of white dudes
lying around in war paint.

254
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:06,434
And I have no fucking
memory how I got there

255
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,837
or what happened while I did.

256
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:11,553
Also,

257
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,735
God did not talk to me.

258
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:18,945
And I'm thinking this is
a fucking waste of time,

259
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:22,850
at best, a misguided detour...

260
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,390
when I notice the TV in
the hotel room is on.

261
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:35,027
And do you know what
I saw on that TV, Chris?

262
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:38,564
A chicken.

263
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,834
On October the 14th,

264
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:45,705
a town in the outback lost
its entire population.

265
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:48,040
A small town, only 14 people.

266
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:51,543
But all of them vanished,
even the animals.

267
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:55,013
Every living thing in that town was gone

268
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:56,715
except for one thing...

269
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,550
An egg.

270
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:01,653
Two days later, it hatched

271
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:03,852
and they named him Tony.

272
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:08,192
At first, nobody took him seriously.

273
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:10,461
But then rumors started.

274
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:14,197
Rumors that the chicken
could help people find

275
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,068
whatever they were looking for.

276
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:19,169
And this is the first
fucking thing I hear

277
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:22,673
when I wake up from a
two-week acid trip?

278
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:25,719
It's got to be a fucking sign. So,

279
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,977
I hop on the train

280
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:31,915
4,000 kilometers back
across the country,

281
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,116
and I go see Tony.

282
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,218
So, I give this guy my money,

283
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,287
guy puts the chicken in front of me,

284
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:39,625
and says,

285
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:41,790
"What are you looking for?"

286
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:45,302
"Well, I don't know
what I'm looking for yet.

287
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:48,096
That's the point. I
need Tony to tell me."

288
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,666
And the guy says,
"Doesn't work that way."

289
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:54,603
"You've gotta give Tony
something to look for."

290
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,972
So I said, "Purpose!"

291
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,275
"I want some fucking purpose."

292
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:07,505
And that very minute,

293
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:11,452
Tony jumped up on my
pack and starts pecking.

294
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:16,323
He was pecking...

295
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:18,892
this.

296
00:22:26,702 --> 00:22:29,668
When my kid was about eight years old,

297
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:33,239
my wife gave him a tape
recorder for Christmas.

298
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:35,474
She died about a month later,

299
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,153
so he...

300
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,112
He kept it with him
all the time. All the time.

301
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:44,282
Well, that summer, I
took him on a road trip

302
00:22:44,284 --> 00:22:46,251
to Niagara Falls.

303
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:52,356
And he just about drove me nuts...

304
00:22:57,163 --> 00:23:01,465
recording everything we said.

305
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,234
Excuse me.

306
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:12,042
I like listening to it.

307
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:17,313
This is the tape that Tony pecked.

308
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:20,316
I didn't rewind it.

309
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,788
I put it in the player

310
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:29,592
and waited for one last
voice to tell me what to do.

311
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:33,629
You have to sing it.

312
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:35,402
Come on.

313
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:38,333
It's for little kids.
You're a big kid now.

314
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,810
You have to or it won't stop.

315
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,794
It's gonna get in the car!

316
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:45,640
We're pulled over. We're safe.

317
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:48,608
Please, Daddy? Just sing it.

318
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,512
Okay.

319
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:17,238
You did it!

320
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:30,717
On the seventh-year anniversary
of the Sudden Departure,

321
00:24:31,484 --> 00:24:34,484
I believe the rains will come,

322
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:36,855
and with them

323
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,557
a great flood.

324
00:24:41,294 --> 00:24:44,195
I have to sing to make it stop.

325
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,783
You have to sing?

326
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,402
For the last two years,

327
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:55,673
I've been working my
way down the songline.

328
00:24:55,675 --> 00:25:00,410
I don't have to tell you every
community has a different part,

329
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:04,715
so I've had to learn
it piece by piece...

330
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:06,816
Every sacred site,

331
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:08,885
every ceremony,

332
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:10,453
every word.

333
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,822
You want my song?

334
00:25:12,824 --> 00:25:15,258
It's the last one.

335
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:20,130
The last one.

336
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:23,099
And it is my understanding

337
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:25,968
that you are the only man alive

338
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,636
who knows it.

339
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:32,174
My song is bring the rain, not stopping.

340
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:35,483
Well,

341
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:40,189
that's all subject to interpretation.

342
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:43,617
You want to stop the flood?

343
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:46,487
I do.

344
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:51,959
Start there.

345
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:01,568
You got a deal.

346
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:11,144
Can you see the problem?

347
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:15,081
Yeah, your swamp cooler's
leaking like a motherfucker.

348
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,770
- Can you fix it, then?
- You got a pipe wrench

349
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,825
or some duct tape...

350
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,906
Shit!

351
00:26:27,642 --> 00:26:29,328
Shit!

352
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,297
Don't believe a word
that woman says about me.

353
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,037
Remember, we've got a deal!

354
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,747
I rolled the other way.
You saw me, right?

355
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:52,449
I... I tried to miss you.

356
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:55,056
- Chris, can you hear me?
- Settle down.

357
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:57,063
I'm just concerned that when we get to

358
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:59,253
the hospital, they're gonna separate us.

359
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:02,425
And Chris promised he'd teach me
something. Didn't you, Chris?

360
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:05,031
Chris, Chris, Chris, nod
if you can hear me.

361
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:07,280
Otherwise, they're not gonna believe me.

362
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,198
Sit! Sit.

363
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,568
Friend, I am acting in
your best interest.

364
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,704
You are looking at an
initiated Yanmedjaran.

365
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:18,775
Show a little respect
for your fucking elder.

366
00:27:32,656 --> 00:27:35,791
I'm sorry I lost it.

367
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,860
You're gonna leave me here?!

368
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:53,507
Fuck me!

369
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:57,629
Fucking, fucking, fuck, fuck, fuck!

370
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:05,118
I don't think this is the
way we're supposed to go.

371
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,167
Garvey men

372
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:10,723
don't follow a highlighter
on a goddamn triptych, son.

373
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:12,658
But what if we get lost?

374
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,993
AAA wants you to take the interstates

375
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:18,030
to get you to drive by
the AAA Howard Johnsons

376
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:20,966
and the AAA giant balls of twine.

377
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:22,767
You want a real adventure,

378
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,769
you gotta chart your own course.

379
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:32,699
Hey!

380
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:40,040
Stop!!

381
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,542
Hey! Stop!

382
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:44,945
Stop!!

383
00:29:44,947 --> 00:29:46,980
Man, what are you doing?

384
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,503
They didn't take me.

385
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:54,797
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down.

386
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:57,123
Let's just talk for a sec.

387
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,700
They didn't take me.

388
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:02,828
Buddy, they didn't take most of us.

389
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,596
You're not alone, trust me.

390
00:30:04,598 --> 00:30:06,865
But that was seven years ago.

391
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:09,723
Would you kill a baby

392
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:11,670
if it would cure cancer?

393
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,441
What?

394
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,075
Would you kill a baby

395
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:18,944
if it would cure cancer?

396
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,914
No.

397
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,386
That is exactly what I said.

398
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:31,979
Wait!

399
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,635
Whoa, shit!

400
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,300
Please let there be water.

401
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:20,835
Please let there be some goddamn water.

402
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:24,771
Fucking alcoholic.

403
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:26,440
Jesus.

404
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,044
I know what you're trying to do,

405
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:32,213
but it's not gonna work!

406
00:31:32,215 --> 00:31:36,117
You can't stop me, asshole!

407
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:00,494
No!

408
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,909
No! No!

409
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:06,811
No!

410
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:08,547
No!

411
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:47,015
Please.

412
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:57,093
Kevin Garvey Jr. Reporting.

413
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:11,947
No. God.

414
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:17,645
God.

415
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:12,847
Buddy, I know you're my totem, but.

416
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:17,434
I got some bad news for you.

417
00:34:17,436 --> 00:34:20,504
If I go down, I don't
think I'm getting up.

418
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:23,040
So...

419
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:27,244
I need to eat you.

420
00:34:30,848 --> 00:34:32,582
I'm sorry.

421
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:36,166
Know that

422
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,791
you gave your life...

423
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:44,760
For something greater than yourself.

424
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:14,088
Come on!

425
00:35:18,676 --> 00:35:20,200
Shit!

426
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:18,561
Help.

427
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:36,578
Hey there.

428
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:08,775
No.

429
00:39:13,582 --> 00:39:15,048
Fucker!

430
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,117
Hello?

431
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:23,789
Anybody here?

432
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:46,043
Hello?

433
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:48,780
Will you accept a collect
international call from...

434
00:39:48,782 --> 00:39:51,215
Kevin Garvey Sr.

435
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:54,618
All right, fine.

436
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:58,388
Do you know what time it is here?

437
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,791
I don't care what time
it is. What day is it?

438
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:02,626
- What?
- What day is it?

439
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:05,043
How long since we last talked?

440
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:08,198
That was three weeks ago.

441
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:10,967
Shit.

442
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:13,440
That's just, like, eight days left.

443
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,170
Shit!

444
00:40:15,172 --> 00:40:17,573
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Kevin.

445
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:19,876
I'm actually glad you called.

446
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:22,979
Could you send a photocopy
of the book back to me?

447
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:25,780
- I... I gave the original...
- I threw it away.

448
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:27,516
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

449
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:31,019
Look, I... I need you to
call the Kurripa Hospital.

450
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:33,454
That's Kur-rip-pa.

451
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:37,458
Find out if there's a patient
there named Christopher Sunday.

452
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,714
Matt?

453
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:43,030
You threw it away?

454
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:46,181
My friend, you've gotta move
past that dumb book of yours.

455
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:49,837
I don't know where I am,
but once I find out,

456
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,673
I'm gonna need your help in
getting to this hospital.

457
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:54,441
- Kevin.
- Yeah?

458
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:56,744
Go fuck yourself.

459
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:31,176
- Hey there!
- Hello.

460
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:35,580
You're building a boat.

461
00:41:41,353 --> 00:41:42,620
For the flood.

462
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:51,327
I need to get to the
hospital in Kurripa.

463
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:54,163
Any chance you guys could
give me a ride there?

464
00:41:54,165 --> 00:41:57,200
Lady of the house will take better
care of you than the hospital.

465
00:41:57,202 --> 00:42:00,990
No, I'm fine. Anybody here
know Christopher Sunday?

466
00:42:01,673 --> 00:42:03,907
Yeah, sure. We all know each other.

467
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:05,174
It's a tiny country.

468
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:06,782
I know Chris.

469
00:42:07,979 --> 00:42:10,412
You're the fella that landed on him.

470
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,416
He's dead.

471
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:21,423
He's dead?

472
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:24,759
Shit.

473
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:54,187
"Caleb's arthritis."

474
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,257
You Caleb?

475
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:59,058
I'm in pain, buddy.

476
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,097
Let him up.

477
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,537
Okay, let him up!

478
00:45:52,156 --> 00:45:53,622
Hey.

479
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,428
What are you ladies up to?

480
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,932
Come on.

481
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,408
Hello.

482
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:50,759
Hi.

483
00:46:52,947 --> 00:46:55,014
Would you like some tea?

484
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:01,452
How's your arm?

485
00:47:03,257 --> 00:47:04,922
Itches like hell.

486
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:10,528
We get a lot of brown and
tiger snakes out here.

487
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,064
I gave you antivenom for
both just to be safe.

488
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:15,933
Much obliged.

489
00:47:22,608 --> 00:47:24,508
You looked through my photos.

490
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:28,145
I was hungry. It was in the fridge.

491
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,117
What's your name?

492
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,287
Grace.

493
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,647
Nice to meet you.

494
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,893
- I'm Kev...
- I just killed a man.

495
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:50,104
Okay.

496
00:47:50,805 --> 00:47:53,201
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

497
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,739
The other ladies you saw,
they had nothing to do with it.

498
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,660
I'm hoping you'll consider leaving them

499
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,789
out of whatever you tell the police.

500
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,880
Are you all alone out here?

501
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:10,112
Yes.

502
00:48:11,237 --> 00:48:13,454
Your family's gone?

503
00:48:14,116 --> 00:48:15,556
Yes.

504
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,026
On the 14th?

505
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:21,028
It was the 15th here.

506
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,197
Fuck. I keep forgetting that.

507
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:27,600
You were with them?

508
00:48:28,787 --> 00:48:30,190
I was in town

509
00:48:31,387 --> 00:48:32,609
at the Big W.

510
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:37,230
The register girl vanished
right in front of me.

511
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,846
She was holding my box of Weet-Bix.

512
00:48:42,116 --> 00:48:43,949
Took it with her.

513
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,021
I knew what it was the
moment it happened.

514
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:53,192
The Rapture.

515
00:48:55,129 --> 00:48:58,929
I finally made it home the next night.

516
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:01,422
I already knew the chapel would be

517
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:04,107
empty before I stepped foot inside.

518
00:49:06,973 --> 00:49:08,706
Their Bibles...

519
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:12,243
Liam's, Abigail's,

520
00:49:12,245 --> 00:49:15,212
David's, Samantha's,

521
00:49:15,214 --> 00:49:18,415
Jimmy's, Sam,

522
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,583
my husband, his Bible, too.

523
00:49:23,522 --> 00:49:25,822
All in a nice, neat row.

524
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:31,994
And when I saw them in that moment...

525
00:49:33,697 --> 00:49:35,664
I felt so blessed...

526
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:38,663
because God showed me.

527
00:49:39,703 --> 00:49:45,074
He gave me confirmation that
my family now sat by his side.

528
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,711
For two years, I spread his word.

529
00:49:50,713 --> 00:49:54,349
For two years, I endured...

530
00:49:56,253 --> 00:49:58,253
and held true.

531
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:08,562
Then I received a phone call.

532
00:50:08,564 --> 00:50:11,598
Remains had been found on my property.

533
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,771
The remains of five children.

534
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:22,896
Just bones.

535
00:50:23,911 --> 00:50:26,145
Bleached in the sun.

536
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,243
The phones were down.

537
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:37,273
They had no way of knowing
if I was ever coming home

538
00:50:38,258 --> 00:50:41,359
or if I had simply vanished
like their father had.

539
00:50:42,596 --> 00:50:44,662
So, they set out on foot...

540
00:50:45,899 --> 00:50:47,832
Across the flats...

541
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:50,802
Alone.

542
00:50:56,576 --> 00:50:59,376
I thought they had gone, you see?

543
00:51:01,414 --> 00:51:03,680
Gone with everyone else.

544
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:12,855
I never even considered
searching for them.

545
00:51:15,627 --> 00:51:17,660
If I had...

546
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:30,305
I took the cross from the chapel

547
00:51:30,307 --> 00:51:32,274
and brought it out there...

548
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,745
To mark the place where they died.

549
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:44,919
The place where I found you.

550
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:55,630
This was in your hand.

551
00:52:01,404 --> 00:52:05,238
A page written like scripture.

552
00:52:06,508 --> 00:52:09,709
One I'd never seen or heard of before.

553
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:11,719
"It tells of a man,"

554
00:52:12,648 --> 00:52:15,148
"a police chief named Kevin..."

555
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:21,587
"who drowned and passed
into the land of the dead"

556
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:23,222
"and spoke to them."

557
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:27,293
"Who freed them from their pain"

558
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:28,827
"and rose again."

559
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:33,732
Just 20 kilometers from here...

560
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:39,270
there's a police Chief named Kevin.

561
00:52:41,274 --> 00:52:43,508
What are the chances of that?

562
00:52:44,711 --> 00:52:46,143
It had to be him.

563
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,481
So, I went to him, to Kevin,

564
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:53,184
and I asked for his help.

565
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:57,395
And when he refused,

566
00:52:57,856 --> 00:52:59,989
I drowned him...

567
00:53:02,728 --> 00:53:06,162
Because I thought he was testing me.

568
00:53:07,466 --> 00:53:10,601
Because I thought he'd come back.

569
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:14,637
And once I'd proven my faith,

570
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:16,856
he would have no choice

571
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:19,251
but to help me talk to my children

572
00:53:20,044 --> 00:53:22,044
one last time.

573
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:30,652
So, I thought you were sent by God.

574
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:37,726
Sent with a message just for me.

575
00:53:48,337 --> 00:53:50,804
But you're not an angel.

576
00:53:52,174 --> 00:53:54,141
There is no message.

577
00:53:55,544 --> 00:53:58,078
And God doesn't care about me.

578
00:54:05,654 --> 00:54:08,854
It's all just a story I told myself.

579
00:54:13,127 --> 00:54:17,497
It's just a stupid, silly story.

580
00:54:20,801 --> 00:54:23,602
And I believed it because...

581
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:35,347
I've gotta be crazy, haven't I?

582
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:43,887
No, Grace.

583
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:49,893
I don't think you're crazy at all.

584
00:54:53,632 --> 00:54:56,866
You just got the wrong Kevin.
