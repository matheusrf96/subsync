2
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,548
Okay.

3
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:42,017
Begin.

4
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,386
My name is Nora Elizabeth
Jamison Durst.

5
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:47,522
Date of birth: 11/18/1979.

6
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:49,839
This is a copy of today's paper.

7
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:56,598
I hereby indemnify all individuals
for the procedure that's about to occur.

8
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:59,933
I'm of sound mind and body,
and I'm acting of my own free will.

9
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,057
- That's it.
- Stop.

10
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:12,731
Something wrong?

11
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,617
Nothing, it-- It's fine.

12
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,535
What did she say?

13
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:20,038
She wants you to do it again.

14
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:23,408
Why do you want me to do it again?

15
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,696
Because I do not believe you.

16
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:29,831
Excuse me?

17
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:33,383
Excuse me, but you're lying.

18
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,888
You're just...

19
00:02:36,938 --> 00:02:40,256
You're just saying
what we want to hear.

20
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:43,745
You invited me here,

21
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:46,431
and then you rejected me.

22
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:49,517
But I sat outside your house
all night and I followed you here,

23
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:53,154
so you'd have no choice
but to let me get into your machine.

24
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:55,571
So, I don't give a shit
what you want to hear.

25
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,742
And I don't lie.

26
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:03,832
Can you say
your children's names?

27
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,617
- What?
- Your children.

28
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,419
Do you think you can say their names?

29
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,170
Erin and Jeremy.

30
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,304
I meant in your statement.

31
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:15,475
Would you like to try again?

32
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:18,144
Okay.

33
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:30,942
My name is Nora Elizabeth
Jamison Durst.

34
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:34,660
I was born on November 18th, 1979.

35
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:40,201
This is a copy of today's paper,

36
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:43,453
because today is the day
I'm leaving to be with them.

37
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:50,161
I'm leaving to be with my children,

38
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:53,012
Erin and Jeremy.

39
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,920
I'm ready to go now.

40
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:07,178
We prefer to give
a more thorough orientation,

41
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:11,316
but since we were in the process
of moving on,

42
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:13,316
you'll just have to bear with us.

43
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,194
Was that a person?

44
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:25,330
It's a fossil.

45
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,046
The person is gone.

46
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,717
Maybe they'll let you keep mine.

47
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:46,851
As soon as we've administered
your saline drip,

48
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:49,604
you will disrobe outside the truck.

49
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,857
Once you are inside, you will see
the event chamber at the far end.

50
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:54,907
You just walk to it.

51
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:59,697
You may experience nausea or discomfort

52
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:01,816
as you pass by
the undulating laser array

53
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,535
while it cycles up.

54
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:06,321
Do not touch the array.

55
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:07,989
Step inside the event chamber,

56
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,741
close the exit port behind you,

57
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,042
and turn the latch to the left.

58
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:13,495
Hard to the left. It'll stick.

59
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,547
Then pull your knees
towards your chest

60
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:17,263
and hold them there.

61
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,419
- Okay?
- Okay.

62
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:25,056
We will be monitoring you
from inside there.

63
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,558
Once inside the event chamber,

64
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:29,894
you will be able to hear us
and we will be able to hear you.

65
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:33,648
When you're ready,
we will start the ignition sequence.

66
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,984
You will hear three tones.

67
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:40,238
After the third tone,
the chamber will fill up with fluid.

68
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:42,941
The fluid will have
the same consistency as water,

69
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:44,776
but it is not water.

70
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:48,828
It contains metals
that will be irradiated.

71
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:53,633
Once this occurs,
the fluid will solidify.

72
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,622
Do not ingest or breathe in
any of the fluid

73
00:05:57,672 --> 00:06:00,806
as your lungs would also solidify
upon transport.

74
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:07,096
Can you hold your breath
for 30 seconds?

75
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:09,849
Yes.

76
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:13,421
Well...

77
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,188
then that's it.

78
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:25,567
Activity.

79
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:26,618
Pole dancing.

80
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,705
Um, noun.

81
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,624
Gecko.

82
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:34,993
Gecko. Excellent.

83
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,496
Okay, last one.

84
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:40,582
Man's name.

85
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,634
Antonio.

86
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:45,670
Antonio. Perfect.

87
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,971
Okay, here we go.

88
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:49,390
"Nora Elizabeth Jamison Durst,

89
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,226
Age 417..."

90
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:54,646
"...was vaporized by a consortium
of international physicists

91
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:57,482
last Tuesday outside Never Never Land.

92
00:06:57,532 --> 00:07:00,235
Miss Durst was born
and raised in Cairo, Egypt..."

93
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,187
- Mmm.
- "...Where she returned after college

94
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:04,739
to squeeze a family..."

95
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,524
"...her spiffy husband, Doug Durst,

96
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:09,410
and her beloved geese,
Jeremy and Erin.

97
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,196
Admired by her coworkers,

98
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:12,864
she was a longtime employee

99
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:15,166
at the Department
of the Sudden Diarrhea."

100
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:17,452
That's disgusting.

101
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:18,670
"In her spare time,

102
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,455
Miss Durst enjoyed crosswords,

103
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:23,007
exposing frauds, and pole dancing.

104
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:26,094
She is survived,
at least temporarily,

105
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:29,347
by her terminally ill gecko,
Matthew Jamison."

106
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:39,007
"As she lives on in our memories,

107
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,960
and in the Great Antonio in the sky."

108
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,003
Mm.

109
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:48,900
"There will be no funeral
or memorial service."

110
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,817
Mm.

111
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:53,154
Oh, God bless Matt Libs.

112
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:55,538
I couldn't ask for a better obituary.

113
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,592
Happy to oblige.

114
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:05,466
You sending me those things
is what got me through

115
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:07,936
Hellfire and Damnation.

116
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,338
The horrible Bible camp
that Grandma and Pop-Pop

117
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,223
used to send me off to
in the Adirondacks?

118
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:14,475
It wasn't Hellfire and Damnation,

119
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:17,395
it was Camp Holy Spirit.

120
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:20,398
Potato, pah-ta-toe.

121
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:23,268
You were so young with the pigtails.

122
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:26,354
- What were you, eight years old?
- Seven.

123
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:29,991
Do you remember what you said to me
when you put me on the bus?

124
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,360
"Brush your teeth"?

125
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,826
You said...

126
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,748
You said that I was
the bravest girl on Earth.

127
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,037
And every time you sent me a letter

128
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,923
with a new Matt Lib in it,

129
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,258
that's who it was addressed to--

130
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:49,877
"The Bravest Girl on Earth."

131
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,977
I forgot about that.

132
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,982
You drive me fucking nuts.

133
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:00,770
But you've always been
a great gecko, Matt.

134
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,944
If I was a great gecko,
I'd be trying to talk you out of this.

135
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:09,495
You're great because you're not trying.

136
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,703
I'm scared.

137
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:17,536
I'll be fine.

138
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:23,376
Of course you will. You always are.

139
00:09:25,046 --> 00:09:28,681
I'm scared of what'll happen
when I go back to Mary.

140
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,420
And I'm scared of the chemicals

141
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,140
they're going to put in my body
to try and make me better, and...

142
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,224
I'm scared it won't work.

143
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:42,478
I'm scared of dying, Nora.

144
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:50,071
I'm scared my son
will grow up without me,

145
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:55,159
forget my face,

146
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,410
forget the sound of my voice.

147
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:04,333
But most of all,
I'm scared that I'll survive.

148
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,219
Because if I do...

149
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,843
how can I ever stand
in front of a room full of people

150
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:14,045
and convince them
that I have the answers

151
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:17,430
when I have no idea
what the fuck I'm talking about?

152
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:23,185
Do you want to come with me instead?

153
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,810
I think, dear sister,

154
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,743
that defeats the purpose.

155
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:39,370
What are you going
to tell people about me?

156
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,620
About what happened here?

157
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,426
Whatever you want me to.

158
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,636
Are you ready?

159
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:03,177
Of course she's ready.

160
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:05,644
She's the bravest girl on Earth.

161
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,963
- Give it to me!
- No!

162
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:14,799
- It's mine!
- You don't need it anymore!

163
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,784
Give her the blanket.

164
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:19,301
Two hands like a big girl. Good deal.

165
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,476
I'm hungry, Mom. I'm hungry!

166
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,596
- I'm hungry, too!
- No phones at the table.

167
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:31,315
- Yours is out, too.
- I'm waiting to hear about the job.

168
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,518
- This is important, too.
- I want food!

169
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:37,321
I want food! I want food!

170
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,440
- It's coming, buddy.
- I want food!

171
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,826
- Jeremy. Hey.
- I want food!

172
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,911
- I want food!
- Cut it out.

173
00:12:57,558 --> 00:13:00,678
God damn it, I said two hands!

174
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:43,921
Dr. Eden over radio:
Nora, can you hear me?

175
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:45,339
Yes.

176
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:47,773
Your brother is here with us.

177
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,563
Hello, Nora.

178
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,765
Hi, Matt.

179
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,068
I love you.

180
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:59,737
I love you, too.

181
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:02,273
We're going to begin, Nora.

182
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,128
I was worried you'd forgotten.

183
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,308
Don't usually get
so many so close together.

184
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:12,511
Love is in the air.

185
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:22,942
A little extra for your trouble.

186
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:31,113
Sarah, does the name Kevin
mean anything to you?

187
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,171
No.

188
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,377
Are you sure?

189
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:47,081
Because a man calling himself that
came by yesterday.

190
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:50,682
He had a photo. A photo of you.

191
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,305
Did you tell him anything?

192
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:55,687
No, of course not.

193
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:00,859
But I think he knew I was lying.

194
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,756
Nora?

195
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:03,934
Kevin.

196
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,636
Kevin Garvey.

197
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:08,138
I don't know if you remember me.

198
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:11,156
I was the chief of police in Mapleton.

199
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:14,895
We don't know each other really well.

200
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:17,662
We only talked a couple times, really.

201
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,485
There was this dance,

202
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:24,619
a Christmas dance at the high school.

203
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:29,877
We just had a really nice conversation.

204
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,545
Yeah.

205
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:33,161
In the hallway.

206
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:37,001
I don't expect you to remember.

207
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:38,700
It was a long time ago.

208
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:43,205
What are you doing?

209
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:48,012
Well, um,
I've been kind of wandering

210
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:50,312
around Australia on vacation.

211
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:55,269
I-- Just kind of getting off the grid.

212
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,856
You know, trying to avoid
the touristy stuff.

213
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:01,706
I like to get a little lost, you know?

214
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:07,031
Anyway, I was--
I'm in that little town

215
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:09,700
down the road,
and I saw you riding your bike.

216
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,337
And I thought to myself,
"Holy shit, I think that's Nora Durst."

217
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:16,588
And, so, I found out where you lived.

218
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:20,392
And here you are.

219
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,017
- That's not what happened.
- Sorry?

220
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:30,471
You showed a picture of me
to the nun at the convent.

221
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:32,757
That's how you found out where I lived.

222
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:37,622
- Why would I have a picture of you?
- I just came from there.

223
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,368
- She told me that you asked if I--
- Are you married?

224
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:41,468
What?

225
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,249
Are you married
or are you seeing somebody?

226
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,370
I noticed you weren't wearing
a wedding ring.

227
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:56,296
And I saw that they were having
a dance in town tonight.

228
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:59,550
And when I saw you riding your bike,

229
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,669
it reminded me...

230
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:06,423
how I had always wished
I had asked you

231
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:07,606
to dance.

232
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:15,947
Anyway, I know it sounds crazy,
but I felt a connection.

233
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:19,736
So, you know, here we are
in the middle of nowhere

234
00:22:19,786 --> 00:22:22,072
bumping into each other,
and I'm only here for the night,

235
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:26,193
and I figured, uh, you know,

236
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:29,077
if I didn't ask you to dance tonight...

237
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:36,468
I'll never forgive myself.

238
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:41,339
You need to leave now.

239
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:46,263
Okay.

240
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:48,599
I get it.

241
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,551
A guy you barely remember
shows up on your doorstep,

242
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:54,319
asks you to go
on a date with him, but...

243
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,822
I had to try.

244
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:01,610
Please just go.

245
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:04,698
I'll be there if you change your mind.

246
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:06,200
They shut down all of Main Street,

247
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,500
so you're not gonna be able to miss it.

248
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:18,543
It's good to see you, Nora.

249
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:42,045
- Hello?
- Did you tell him?

250
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:44,798
- Nora?
- Did you tell him?

251
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:46,833
I-- I don't understand
what you're asking me.

252
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:49,760
Kevin, fucking Kevin. He's here.

253
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:54,014
- He found me.
- What? He's-- He's there in Australia?

254
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:56,934
Did you tell him where I was, Laurie?

255
00:24:56,984 --> 00:25:00,104
No. No, I didn't.

256
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:03,274
- Because if you did, just say so, and I--
- I didn't.

257
00:25:03,324 --> 00:25:06,644
We established boundaries
the first time you called me.

258
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:07,895
Clear boundaries.

259
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:09,230
I don't tell you
about the people here,

260
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,448
and I don't tell the people here
about you.

261
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,332
I would never betray that, Nora.

262
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:17,621
Then how did he find me?

263
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:19,540
How did he say he found you?

264
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,126
He said that he was here on vacation

265
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,827
and he spotted me.

266
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:26,413
And then he came to my house,
and he knocked on my door,

267
00:25:26,463 --> 00:25:29,133
and he acted like we were
just casual acquaintances

268
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:30,668
from Mapleton years back,

269
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:33,304
like-- Like we were never together.

270
00:25:33,354 --> 00:25:36,355
Like-- Like none of it happened.

271
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:38,559
Huh.

272
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:40,678
"Huh?" What's that mean? "Huh?"

273
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:42,513
Well, I'm just surprised, that's all.

274
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:45,364
It's a very un-Kevin-like thing to do.

275
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,235
Is he crazy?

276
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:49,853
Does he seem crazy?

277
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:53,073
No. He seemed happy.

278
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:54,491
Huh.

279
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,493
Would you please
stop fucking saying that?

280
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:57,911
Okay.

281
00:25:57,961 --> 00:25:59,947
Why-- Why is he doing this?

282
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:01,832
I don't know.

283
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:03,248
Did he say anything else?

284
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:09,039
- He asked me to a dance.
- A dance?

285
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:11,125
I guess there's a dance
in town tonight,

286
00:26:11,175 --> 00:26:12,710
and he asked me to go.

287
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,678
And you don't want to?

288
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:17,298
- No.
- What do you want?

289
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:19,133
Well, I want him to leave me alone.

290
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:22,553
- Then why are you calling me?
- What?

291
00:26:22,603 --> 00:26:24,104
Well, I can't make him
leave you alone.

292
00:26:24,154 --> 00:26:27,441
I'm half a world away,
so why did you call me?

293
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:30,394
I called you because I thought
you told him where I was.

294
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:33,578
Come on, you know
I didn't tell him that.

295
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:38,285
You called me
because you wanted me to say

296
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,703
it's okay to go to the dance.

297
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:43,157
I do not want to go
to the fucking dance!

298
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:45,040
Gotcha.

299
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,995
But if you did, it's okay.

300
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:50,831
Jesus Christ, Laurie.

301
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:52,964
Same time next week?

302
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:10,974
Where are your beads?

303
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:13,477
- Excuse me?
- Your beads. You need beads.

304
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:16,027
- Here, take one of mine.
- No, thank you.

305
00:32:11,952 --> 00:32:13,787
You came.

306
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:15,656
It's a wedding.

307
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:17,958
I know.

308
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:20,041
You told me it was a dance.

309
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:23,261
People are dancing.

310
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:30,935
- Were you even invited?
- Yeah, of course I was.

311
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:37,227
Um... that's Eddie.

312
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:39,012
He can take a tractor apart,

313
00:32:39,062 --> 00:32:41,314
put it back together blindfolded.

314
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:43,400
Allegedly.

315
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,234
And that's Aggie.

316
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:49,322
She was in the Army.

317
00:32:49,372 --> 00:32:51,456
She left. Too many rules.

318
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:55,245
I bumped into them at the hotel bar.

319
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:57,829
They told me if I didn't come,
they'd be angry with me.

320
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,133
How did you find me, Kevin?

321
00:33:04,054 --> 00:33:07,007
I'm on vacation in Australia.

322
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:08,592
I saw you ride by on your bike.

323
00:33:08,642 --> 00:33:10,127
This is the middle of nowhere.

324
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:11,795
Why would you come here on vacation?

325
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:15,432
My father came Down Under a while back

326
00:33:15,482 --> 00:33:17,384
and told me it was an amazing place,

327
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:20,020
so I just wanted to see for myself.

328
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,305
So, you're saying
you've never been here before.

329
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:24,057
This is your first time in Australia.

330
00:33:24,107 --> 00:33:26,359
Uh-huh.

331
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:28,610
You're really gonna keep this up?

332
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,946
Keep what up?

333
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:37,454
So, you and me,
we only talked that one time

334
00:33:37,504 --> 00:33:39,322
at that Christmas dance in Mapleton.

335
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:41,324
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:33:41,374 --> 00:33:43,675
What about the courthouse?

337
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:48,131
We got our divorces on the same day
and ran into each other.

338
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:49,633
I asked you to go to Miami.

339
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:51,468
- You asked me to go to Miami?
- Miami.

340
00:33:51,518 --> 00:33:52,684
Yes.

341
00:33:53,854 --> 00:33:55,839
But we were strangers?

342
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,725
Yes.

343
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:01,311
And you're giving me a hard time
about inviting you to a dance?

344
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:02,694
It's a wedding.

345
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:07,365
You must have me confused
with someone else.

346
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:11,655
Because if you asked me
to go to Miami with you,

347
00:34:11,705 --> 00:34:13,571
I definitely would've gone.

348
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:17,208
I love Miami.

349
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:25,216
So-- So, you never left?

350
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:29,923
You've been a cop
in Mapleton all this time?

351
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:32,459
Uh-huh.

352
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:36,010
Then you knew my brother,
Matt Jamison.

353
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,900
I was hoping
you were gonna come to the funeral.

354
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:47,105
We said our goodbyes in person.

355
00:34:48,658 --> 00:34:50,742
It was a beautiful service.

356
00:34:51,912 --> 00:34:53,945
Over 400 people came.

357
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:57,749
Mary gave the eulogy.

358
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:02,537
She really loved him.

359
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,924
There was a lot to love.

360
00:35:11,932 --> 00:35:13,765
How are Jill and Tom?

361
00:35:16,436 --> 00:35:18,588
You remember my kids' names?

362
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,438
Yeah.

363
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:22,941
I remember.

364
00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:27,562
It's a little creepy,
but I am impressed.

365
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:34,487
Jill's great.

366
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:36,907
She married a great guy.

367
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:39,109
They have a daughter together.

368
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:42,076
Penelope. About a year old now.

369
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:46,297
And I'm a fucking grandpa.

370
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:50,587
Tommy's marriage
didn't work out so great.

371
00:35:50,637 --> 00:35:53,972
But he landed on his feet,
like he always does.

372
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:58,142
- What about you?
- Me?

373
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:01,431
Did you ever get married again?

374
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:02,647
No.

375
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:05,934
Why not?

376
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:11,155
Because I'm still holding a candle
for you.

377
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:18,029
I find that hard to believe.

378
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:20,784
My mom died when I was nine.

379
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:23,284
My dad never remarried, so...

380
00:36:25,288 --> 00:36:27,288
People hold candles, Nora.

381
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:36,716
- How is your dad?
- He's fantastic.

382
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:40,136
Jesus!

383
00:36:40,186 --> 00:36:43,173
- He's 91 and he's still kicking.
- He must be immortal.

384
00:36:43,223 --> 00:36:46,524
Oh, runs in the family, right?

385
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:51,398
- I'm not immortal.
- Oh?

386
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:52,933
Says who?

387
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:55,819
My cardiologist.

388
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,821
I had a condition.

389
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:00,154
It was undiagnosed my whole life.

390
00:37:01,574 --> 00:37:04,042
A couple years back,
I had a heart attack.

391
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:07,328
A pretty-- pretty bad one.

392
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,836
But if they hadn't
diagnosed the condition,

393
00:37:12,886 --> 00:37:14,337
then I wouldn't have known
I had had it,

394
00:37:14,387 --> 00:37:17,007
and blah, blah, blah, so...

395
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:20,126
They just cut me open,
put in a pacemaker.

396
00:37:20,176 --> 00:37:22,093
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

397
00:37:23,596 --> 00:37:25,598
Wanna see my scar?

398
00:37:25,648 --> 00:37:27,050
She came!

399
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,852
You said she wouldn't come.

400
00:37:28,902 --> 00:37:32,188
Oh, I'm just as surprised as you are.

401
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:34,774
- Oops.
- Aggie, this is Nora.

402
00:37:34,824 --> 00:37:36,943
- Nora, this is Aggie.
- Congratulations.

403
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:39,529
- He didn't think you were coming.
- Yeah, you mentioned that.

404
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:41,698
Nice of you to get
all dressed up for my wedding.

405
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:43,450
I'm sorry, I didn't know
it was a wedding.

406
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,118
I'm just fucking with you.

407
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:46,703
She's very serious.

408
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:47,871
Yeah.

409
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:50,573
Wouldn't have it any other way.

410
00:37:50,623 --> 00:37:51,825
All right, that's enough chitchat.

411
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,626
Did you write your messages?

412
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:55,426
I gave mine to the nun.

413
00:37:57,097 --> 00:37:58,715
Hi.

414
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:00,166
What about you, sweetheart?

415
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:05,422
Want to write a message of love
to send out to the world?

416
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:07,057
No, thank you.

417
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:09,392
And she's a romantic, too.

418
00:38:09,442 --> 00:38:11,895
All right, let's get these over with!

419
00:38:11,945 --> 00:38:14,278
Where the fuck's Eddie?

420
00:38:16,866 --> 00:38:19,784
What did you tell her about us?

421
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:23,573
I told her I had a crush on a girl

422
00:38:23,623 --> 00:38:26,910
and I wanted to chase after her,

423
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,162
but I didn't know what to say.

424
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:36,036
All right, everyone,
settle down.

425
00:38:36,086 --> 00:38:38,121
I'm talking now!

426
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:40,707
Oi! Listen up, fuckwits!

427
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:48,631
All right, dearest family,
beloved friends,

428
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:49,599
and Russell.

429
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:51,149
Oi!

430
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:53,720
Eddie and I just wanna thank you all

431
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,889
for being here on our special day

432
00:38:55,939 --> 00:38:58,892
to drink our alcohol free of charge.

433
00:39:01,694 --> 00:39:04,447
Sweetheart, I am so happy

434
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:07,117
that we're gonna spend
the rest of our lives together.

435
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:11,154
And now that you've married me,
I have a confession.

436
00:39:11,204 --> 00:39:12,956
I think I might be pregnant.

437
00:39:14,674 --> 00:39:16,543
- No!
- Not to worry, love.

438
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:20,747
- It's yours, probably.
- Oh!

439
00:39:20,797 --> 00:39:23,500
All right,
let's get to the ooey-gooey.

440
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,002
We have gathered your notes

441
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:28,638
and attached them
to these beautiful birds.

442
00:39:30,607 --> 00:39:32,725
And now we are going to set them free

443
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:36,229
so they can fly off
to every corner of the world,

444
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:39,182
spreading those messages of love
to people everywhere.

445
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:41,818
Aw!

446
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:43,367
All right, Sister.

447
00:39:44,404 --> 00:39:45,486
Release the birds!

448
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:00,918
What did you write?

449
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,059
That's for me to know
and some lonely Eskimo to find out.

450
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:11,014
Isn't that romantic, eh?

451
00:40:11,064 --> 00:40:14,267
Yeah, let's hear it for the love birds!

452
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:16,184
Whoo!

453
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:22,192
See, if only life was just about love.

454
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:25,145
But it's about temptation.

455
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:27,480
It's about failure.

456
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,532
It's about weakness.

457
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:32,619
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you, Sister?

458
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:35,288
It's about sin, yeah.

459
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:38,374
And everybody here knows
I've made my fair share of mistakes,

460
00:40:38,424 --> 00:40:44,130
but there is a very big difference
between a sin and a mistake.

461
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,550
Because a mistake
is just fucking up, hmm?

462
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,219
But a sin-- hoo-hoo.

463
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:52,255
A sin is when you know
something is wrong

464
00:40:52,305 --> 00:40:54,305
and you do it anyway.

465
00:40:56,526 --> 00:40:58,144
So, Aggie,

466
00:40:58,194 --> 00:40:59,929
my darling wife,

467
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:02,849
my sun and my stars,

468
00:41:02,899 --> 00:41:05,518
I look forward to a lifetime
of fucking up with you.

469
00:41:06,903 --> 00:41:11,241
But I hereby swear
I will never sin again.

470
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:13,824
Aw!

471
00:41:19,749 --> 00:41:21,417
Now bring out that fucking goat!

472
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:24,370
Yeah!

473
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,956
Hello! In biblical times,

474
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:30,210
a goat was designated
to be driven into the desert

475
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,428
with the sins
of the community upon it.

476
00:41:32,478 --> 00:41:34,597
So...

477
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:37,315
...let these beads represent our sins.

478
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,439
Unburden yourselves, friends.

479
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:45,692
Then Russell will drive the scapegoat

480
00:41:45,742 --> 00:41:47,777
deep into the bush, far from here,

481
00:41:47,827 --> 00:41:49,395
so we can start over

482
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:52,615
untainted by our past mistakes.

483
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:06,961
At least they didn't sacrifice it.

484
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:11,551
Have you ever seen
somebody sacrifice a goat?

485
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:13,586
No.

486
00:42:13,636 --> 00:42:15,219
That'd be weird.

487
00:42:24,731 --> 00:42:26,349
Three, four.

488
00:42:28,901 --> 00:42:31,487
- One, two, three, four.
- Al, don't count, don't say four,

489
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:33,656
'cause I'm gonna be on you.

490
00:44:58,468 --> 00:45:01,051
How did you find me, Kevin?

491
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:06,342
I'm on vacation in Australia.

492
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:17,487
I can't do this.

493
00:45:17,537 --> 00:45:18,988
Why not?

494
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:20,656
Because it's not true.

495
00:47:36,175 --> 00:47:37,508
Evening.

496
00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:14,497
- Sarah.
- What did you do with my birds?

497
00:48:14,547 --> 00:48:18,984
I let them go just like I always do.
What's wrong?

498
00:48:19,034 --> 00:48:20,119
What's wrong
is that they didn't come back.

499
00:48:20,169 --> 00:48:22,370
Did you give them the seed
that I gave you?

500
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,422
Yes, of course.

501
00:48:23,472 --> 00:48:26,175
And-- And you didn't feed them
right before you let them go, did you?

502
00:48:26,225 --> 00:48:28,761
No, of course not.
I did everything the same.

503
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:30,846
- Then where are they?
- I don't know.

504
00:48:30,896 --> 00:48:32,632
Those birds are trained
to do one thing,

505
00:48:32,682 --> 00:48:34,183
just one thing,
and that's to come home,

506
00:48:34,233 --> 00:48:35,851
so you must've done
something different.

507
00:48:35,901 --> 00:48:38,102
Maybe they're delivering
the messages of love.

508
00:48:39,405 --> 00:48:40,973
It's great that your newlyweds believe

509
00:48:41,023 --> 00:48:42,608
that a bird with a range of 50 miles

510
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:44,860
is gonna carry their stupid poetry
to Timbuktu,

511
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,395
but don't sell that bullshit to me.

512
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:49,246
I'm not trying to sell you anything.

513
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,902
It's just a nicer story.

514
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,038
Who was that man?

515
00:48:56,088 --> 00:48:57,790
What man?

516
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,209
The man I just saw leaving.

517
00:49:00,259 --> 00:49:01,711
You mean Father Brian.

518
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:03,627
He's the only man
permitted in the convent.

519
00:49:04,764 --> 00:49:07,049
Does Father Brian ride a motorcycle?

520
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:08,968
- No.
- Well, this man did.

521
00:49:09,018 --> 00:49:12,338
And he was climbing a ladder down
from that room right up there.

522
00:49:12,388 --> 00:49:15,725
Oh, well, that's strange.

523
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,393
Is that your room?

524
00:49:17,443 --> 00:49:19,562
It might be.

525
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:21,812
But I certainly haven't seen
any men on ladders.

526
00:49:23,032 --> 00:49:24,617
You just had sex with him.

527
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:26,736
- Oh, no, I didn't.
- You did.

528
00:49:26,786 --> 00:49:29,105
- Did not.
- Then swear to God.

529
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:30,454
All right.

530
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:35,077
I swear to God.

531
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:37,294
You're a fucking liar!

532
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:43,419
I saw you dancing with that man.

533
00:49:43,469 --> 00:49:46,122
That man you said you didn't know.

534
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:53,594
I'll pray for the safe return
of your birds.

535
00:49:55,014 --> 00:49:57,099
Don't waste your breath.

536
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:41,894
Oh, God.

537
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:58,158
Oh, God.

538
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:53,547
Ah!

539
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,633
Oh, shh, shh, shh...

540
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:47,353
I know. Okay.

541
00:52:47,403 --> 00:52:49,770
Shh.

542
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:40,439
Hey, you hungry?

543
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:32,089
Hey!

544
00:54:36,428 --> 00:54:38,797
Eat this, you idiot.

545
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,215
Here.

546
00:54:40,265 --> 00:54:41,598
Come on.

547
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,100
_

548
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,100
_

549
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,600
_

550
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:36,350
_

551
00:55:54,506 --> 00:55:56,506
You wanna know how I found you, Nora?

552
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:59,876
You want the truth?

553
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:06,883
When Matt told me you were gone,
I didn't believe him.

554
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,055
Or I couldn't.

555
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:14,024
I just-- I had this feeling
that you were still alive...

556
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,726
and that I would see you again.

557
00:56:20,149 --> 00:56:22,017
And then-- then Matt died

558
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:24,153
and you weren't even at the funeral.

559
00:56:24,203 --> 00:56:26,405
And that should've convinced me,

560
00:56:26,455 --> 00:56:30,826
but I couldn't believe the last time
I saw you or talked to you

561
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:32,277
was in that fucking hotel room

562
00:56:32,327 --> 00:56:35,212
that night I burned his fucking book.

563
00:56:38,884 --> 00:56:43,172
I was so sure you were still alive,

564
00:56:43,222 --> 00:56:46,223
even though everyone else in the world
said that you were fucking dead.

565
00:56:49,178 --> 00:56:50,427
God, I...

566
00:56:51,597 --> 00:56:53,763
I had to do something about it.

567
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,568
So I decided
that I was gonna look for you.

568
00:57:00,822 --> 00:57:03,106
I was gonna start
right where I lost you.

569
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:09,364
Every year,
I have two weeks of vacation,

570
00:57:09,414 --> 00:57:11,867
and every year,
I come to fucking Australia

571
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:15,370
and I show your picture
to everybody I meet.

572
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,788
"Do you know this woman?

573
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:19,041
Have you ever seen her before?"

574
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:21,960
And they all just look at me
and they shake their heads and they say,

575
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,545
"Oh, I'm sorry."

576
00:57:23,595 --> 00:57:25,462
Everybody's so fucking sorry.

577
00:57:26,765 --> 00:57:28,381
But I couldn't stop.

578
00:57:30,602 --> 00:57:32,921
Every year, I would say to myself,

579
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:34,556
"I can't do this.

580
00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:36,258
I'm not doing this.

581
00:57:36,308 --> 00:57:37,676
Never again."

582
00:57:37,726 --> 00:57:39,309
But every year, I would come back.

583
00:57:40,779 --> 00:57:41,945
Because...

584
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:45,115
Because I couldn't stop.

585
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:49,119
And a couple days ago...

586
00:57:50,372 --> 00:57:52,405
I showed your picture to that nun...

587
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:56,161
and I saw it in her eyes.

588
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:57,661
She recognized you.

589
00:57:59,631 --> 00:58:01,166
She knew you.

590
00:58:03,802 --> 00:58:05,468
And when I saw you...

591
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:10,840
I couldn't believe it.

592
00:58:13,095 --> 00:58:14,644
There you were.

593
00:58:16,348 --> 00:58:18,481
And I was so...

594
00:58:23,322 --> 00:58:26,391
Oh, but I didn't know what to say...

595
00:58:27,943 --> 00:58:29,444
...or where to start,

596
00:58:29,494 --> 00:58:32,030
and so I just thought,
"Oh, fuck it. I'll erase it.

597
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,866
Just erase it all and maybe that
would give us another chance."

598
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:42,339
But you were right.

599
00:58:44,626 --> 00:58:46,176
It's not true.

600
00:58:49,848 --> 00:58:51,750
That's how I found you, Nora.

601
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,716
I...

602
00:58:55,554 --> 00:58:57,554
I refused to believe you were gone.

603
00:59:03,195 --> 00:59:05,228
You want some tea?

604
00:59:08,533 --> 00:59:09,482
What?

605
00:59:10,819 --> 00:59:13,536
I was gonna make a cup of tea.
You want some?

606
00:59:16,742 --> 00:59:17,874
Okay.

607
00:59:33,225 --> 00:59:34,557
You want one?

608
00:59:35,594 --> 00:59:37,560
No. I quit.

609
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:41,398
Heart.

610
00:59:44,936 --> 00:59:47,139
So, that part is true?

611
00:59:47,189 --> 00:59:48,571
Mm-hmm.

612
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:52,609
That part is true.

613
00:59:57,866 --> 00:59:59,282
What else is true?

614
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:06,089
Everything I said about Matt's funeral.

615
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:10,260
Everything I told you
about Jill and Tommy...

616
01:00:11,296 --> 01:00:12,998
my father.

617
01:00:13,048 --> 01:00:15,834
Did you move back to Mapleton?

618
01:00:15,884 --> 01:00:17,052
No.

619
01:00:17,102 --> 01:00:18,601
Still in Jarden.

620
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:20,922
In our house.

621
01:00:20,972 --> 01:00:23,842
Anyone still call it Miracle?

622
01:00:23,892 --> 01:00:25,394
Not so much.

623
01:00:25,444 --> 01:00:27,679
How are the Murphys?

624
01:00:27,729 --> 01:00:31,064
Uh, Michael's pretty much
running the church now.

625
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:35,687
I see Erika there
every once in a while.

626
01:00:35,737 --> 01:00:37,406
She's great.

627
01:00:37,456 --> 01:00:40,457
And John and Laurie
still live next door.

628
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:47,797
I talk to Laurie sometimes.

629
01:00:50,469 --> 01:00:53,088
- What?
- Every once in a while.

630
01:00:53,138 --> 01:00:54,971
Just when I need to.

631
01:00:56,892 --> 01:00:59,511
- She knows you're here?
- Don't be mad at her.

632
01:00:59,561 --> 01:01:02,431
She's my therapist.
She wasn't allowed to tell you.

633
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:04,466
Why didn't you tell me?

634
01:01:04,516 --> 01:01:07,183
Because you were right, Kevin.

635
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:11,106
What you said in the hotel,

636
01:01:11,156 --> 01:01:13,156
the last time we saw each other.

637
01:01:14,743 --> 01:01:16,311
I needed to be with my kids.

638
01:01:16,361 --> 01:01:17,646
Oh, no, I didn't mean that--

639
01:01:17,696 --> 01:01:19,731
You meant it,
and you were right, Kevin.

640
01:01:19,781 --> 01:01:24,619
There were always gonna be
bulletproof vests,

641
01:01:24,669 --> 01:01:26,336
hugs from holy men...

642
01:01:27,622 --> 01:01:29,372
tattoos to cover up.

643
01:01:30,926 --> 01:01:34,461
But those were just ways
to deal with what I lost.

644
01:01:37,015 --> 01:01:39,466
I needed a way to get them back.

645
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:45,090
I knew there was a chance
it would kill me,

646
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,023
but I made my peace with that.

647
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,144
And I said goodbye to my brother...

648
01:01:52,697 --> 01:01:54,766
and I climbed right in.

649
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,576
And then you changed your mind.

650
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:07,162
No.

651
01:02:07,212 --> 01:02:09,712
I didn't change my mind.

652
01:02:11,633 --> 01:02:13,750
I went through.

653
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,796
I was in the parking lot,

654
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:26,012
naked...

655
01:02:27,399 --> 01:02:29,232
curled up like a baby.

656
01:02:31,903 --> 01:02:34,022
It was the same parking lot
I'd just been in,

657
01:02:34,072 --> 01:02:35,772
except there were no trucks...

658
01:02:36,992 --> 01:02:39,409
no people, no nothing.

659
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:47,417
It was cold, so I started to walk.

660
01:02:48,837 --> 01:02:51,621
I walked by empty houses...

661
01:02:52,674 --> 01:02:54,374
abandoned buildings.

662
01:02:55,677 --> 01:02:56,995
And I found a store,

663
01:02:57,045 --> 01:03:00,248
so I went in
and there were clothes there--

664
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:01,633
clothes hanging on racks--

665
01:03:01,683 --> 01:03:05,768
so I got dressed
and I got back to walking.

666
01:03:10,108 --> 01:03:12,143
I walked long enough
to convince myself

667
01:03:12,193 --> 01:03:14,611
that I was the only thing
alive in that place.

668
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:18,183
And then night came,

669
01:03:18,233 --> 01:03:21,401
and I saw lights, so I went to them.

670
01:03:22,787 --> 01:03:24,356
It was a house,

671
01:03:24,406 --> 01:03:26,906
and there was a man and a women there.

672
01:03:28,043 --> 01:03:29,945
They were kind

673
01:03:29,995 --> 01:03:31,628
and they told me...

674
01:03:33,131 --> 01:03:36,668
the man told me
that seven years earlier,

675
01:03:36,718 --> 01:03:38,064
he was in a supermarket

676
01:03:38,164 --> 01:03:41,421
and every single person
disappeared except for him.

677
01:03:44,059 --> 01:03:48,847
And the women told me
that she lost her husband,

678
01:03:48,897 --> 01:03:50,465
her three daughters,

679
01:03:50,515 --> 01:03:52,599
and all eight of her grandchildren.

680
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:56,436
And that's when I understood.

681
01:03:57,656 --> 01:04:01,324
Over here, we lost some of them.

682
01:04:02,611 --> 01:04:06,446
But over there, they lost all of us.

683
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:13,169
So, I went and did
what I came there to do.

684
01:04:15,006 --> 01:04:17,006
I went to find my kids.

685
01:04:20,261 --> 01:04:21,913
Planes don't really fly over there.

686
01:04:21,963 --> 01:04:24,714
They have enough resources,
just not enough pilots.

687
01:04:26,051 --> 01:04:27,967
So, I found a boat that would take me.

688
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:32,807
No boats go directly
from Australia to New York,

689
01:04:32,857 --> 01:04:35,892
so it took me
a long time to get there.

690
01:04:37,195 --> 01:04:39,395
A long time.

691
01:04:41,316 --> 01:04:42,699
But I finally did.

692
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:50,206
And I walked through Mapleton.

693
01:04:53,378 --> 01:04:57,580
I walked through
the town where I grew up...

694
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:04,589
where my parents died,

695
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:05,888
and Matt.

696
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:10,510
Where you and I met.

697
01:05:13,565 --> 01:05:16,184
Most of the houses
were overgrown with weeds,

698
01:05:16,234 --> 01:05:18,553
but the streetlights
still turned on at night,

699
01:05:18,603 --> 01:05:19,888
and that made me feel less stupid

700
01:05:19,938 --> 01:05:22,691
about expecting them
to still be there.

701
01:05:22,741 --> 01:05:26,275
Still there in the very same house
where I lost them.

702
01:05:28,413 --> 01:05:30,949
When I got there, I stood
behind a tree across the street

703
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:34,534
and I waited because I was too scared
to go up and knock.

704
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:40,041
And then, after a while,

705
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:41,874
the door opened.

706
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:47,463
At first, I didn't recognize them.

707
01:05:49,267 --> 01:05:53,553
A tall teenage boy...

708
01:05:54,656 --> 01:05:56,055
with curly hair...

709
01:05:59,394 --> 01:06:01,262
and a girl,

710
01:06:01,312 --> 01:06:02,779
maybe 11.

711
01:06:06,317 --> 01:06:07,900
They were my children.

712
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,913
And then my husband came out,
and he was with a woman.

713
01:06:18,963 --> 01:06:20,415
She was pretty.

714
01:06:20,465 --> 01:06:24,667
She was pretty,
and they were all smiling.

715
01:06:29,924 --> 01:06:31,424
They were...

716
01:06:33,645 --> 01:06:34,977
happy.

717
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:42,103
And I understood
that here in this place,

718
01:06:42,153 --> 01:06:44,320
they were the lucky ones.

719
01:06:47,325 --> 01:06:50,612
In a world full of orphans,

720
01:06:50,662 --> 01:06:52,495
they still had each other.

721
01:06:56,501 --> 01:06:58,201
And I was a ghost.

722
01:07:00,672 --> 01:07:03,339
I was a ghost who had no place there.

723
01:07:08,346 --> 01:07:11,681
And that, Kevin,
is when I changed my mind.

724
01:07:16,855 --> 01:07:18,640
The physicists who sent me through

725
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:20,475
told me the first person
to use the machine

726
01:07:20,525 --> 01:07:22,191
was the guy who invented it.

727
01:07:23,695 --> 01:07:25,561
His name was Dr. Van Eeghen.

728
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:28,316
I'm pretty sure
they were making fun of me,

729
01:07:28,366 --> 01:07:32,237
but they said when I went over
that I should look him up, so I did.

730
01:07:32,287 --> 01:07:34,320
That took a long time, too.

731
01:07:35,874 --> 01:07:38,026
But I found him

732
01:07:38,076 --> 01:07:39,994
and I asked him
to make another machine

733
01:07:40,044 --> 01:07:42,864
because he already knew how.

734
01:07:42,914 --> 01:07:46,084
And he asked me
if I had come all that way,

735
01:07:46,134 --> 01:07:48,503
why in God's name did I wanna go back?

736
01:07:48,553 --> 01:07:51,387
And I told him
it's because I didn't belong there.

737
01:07:52,757 --> 01:07:54,056
So, he built it.

738
01:07:55,176 --> 01:07:56,726
And I came back through.

739
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:59,512
I came back here.

740
01:08:10,158 --> 01:08:11,440
Did I...

741
01:08:13,912 --> 01:08:15,411
think about you?

742
01:08:22,203 --> 01:08:23,920
Did I wanna call you?

743
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:28,925
Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?

744
01:08:30,345 --> 01:08:31,878
Of course I did.

745
01:08:36,267 --> 01:08:38,467
But so much time had passed.

746
01:08:42,774 --> 01:08:45,725
It was too late.

747
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:55,117
And I knew that
if I told you what happened...

748
01:08:56,454 --> 01:08:58,321
that you would never believe me.

749
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:07,830
I believe you.

750
01:09:19,477 --> 01:09:20,643
You do?

751
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:24,480
Why wouldn't I believe you?

752
01:09:26,734 --> 01:09:27,850
You're here.

753
01:09:53,761 --> 01:09:55,177
I'm here.

754
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:01,540
